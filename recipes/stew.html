    <p>
    My mum is German and she would make this filling stew during the winter. We all loved it, so I thought I'd share!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pound flank steak, cut into 1/2-inch cubes </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil, or more as needed </li>
        <li>4 carrots, chopped </li>
        <li>1 onion, diced </li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, thinly sliced </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes </li>
        <li>1 cup dry lentils </li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried rosemary </li>
        <li>11 ounces baby potatoes with skin </li>
