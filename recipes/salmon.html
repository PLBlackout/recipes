  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Fresh, Asian-inspired salmon fillets with a crispy skin and an orange, ginger, and honey glaze. Unlike most similar recipes, this one is made without soy sauce and with totally fresh ingredients. The result is a bright, fresh fish with great taste and texture. The fresh ingredients are the star here: Don't substitute with dried, powdered, or frozen ingredients! I served on top of rice and steamed broccoli garnished with green onions.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>½ cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
    <li>¼ cup honey </li>
    <li>¼ cup rice vinegar </li>
    <li>¼ cup olive oil </li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds </li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 skin-on salmon fillets </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Combine orange juice, honey, vinegar, olive oil, garlic, ginger, sesame seeds, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Add salmon. Seal and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.</p></li>
    <li><p>Place a large cast iron skillet in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</p></li>
    <li><p>Carefully remove skillet from oven when it just barely starts to smoke. Add vegetable oil and place salmon fillets, skin-side down, in the skillet.</p></li>
    <li><p>Bake in the hot oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, or to your desired doneness, 5 to 9 minutes. Serve immediately.</p></li>
  </ol>
